								<b>University of Pittsburgh - Advisor: Dr. Rachel Bezanson </b><br> 
								I studied the assembly history of stars in galaxies at half the age of the universe using the UniverseMachine model, 
								a sophisticated galaxy-dark matter halo connection model that tracks N-body simulations across cosmic 
								times. With this, I find the discrepancies and similarities between simulations and observations from the 
								Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) Spectroscopic Survey to study where our current 
								understanding of the physics behind galaxy evolution might be incomplete.

								I quantified the formation time scales of simulated galaxies (when these galaxies formed 50% and 90% of their total stellar mass) and 
								compared with those observed in LEGA-C. Here we found that the observational correlations between formation time and stellar mass are weaker 
								than predicted by the UniverseMachine and that this discrepancy is especially pronounced for the quiescent sample.

								This work revolves around studying rare galaxies that deviate from traditional evolutionary paths and show a sudden episode 
								of star-formation after a long period of quiescence. 
								I investigated these rejuvenating galaxies in UniverseMachine simulations and compared them with observational evidence. 
								The goal is to quantify their number density and understand the physical processes that could be driving this phenomenon. Here, we see
								that there is a peak dark matter halo mass that has highest amount of rejuvenating galaxies. (Kaushal+2024 in prep)
